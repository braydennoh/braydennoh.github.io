I had the opportunity to visit Seattle during Thanksgiving break of 2022—opportunity here meaning I had saved just enough money and found a cheap flight. From LAX to Sea-Tac takes just under three hours. Funny enough, the public transportation from Caltech to LAX takes nearly the same amount of time—around two hours by a combination of bus, metro, and the FlyAway bus from Union Station.

### Arriving in Seattle

I landed at Sea-Tac just before sunset (~4:30 PM). Since I planned to be outdoors most of the time, I booked a hostel near the main attractions. It ended up being right next to Pike Place Market.

Unfortunately, I arrived on Thanksgiving night, so nearly all restaurants were closed—except for Hard Rock Cafe. So yes, dinner that night was a 2000-calorie cheeseburger with two IPAs.

### Running in the Rain

Friday morning, it poured. Still, I went out for a run. There's something refreshing about running in the rain—it makes you feel less tired. The water cools you down, washes away the sweat, and you don’t have to worry about dehydration.

I ran through downtown and around the Space Needle, soaking in the city.

### Mount Rainier National Park

The highlight of the trip came the next day. I rented a Toyota Tacoma from the airport and drove ~80 miles down to Mount Rainier National Park. The drive took me through small towns, forests, and stunning lake views.

In November, the only open visitor center is the Henry M. Jackson Memorial Visitor Center in the Paradise area. Roads are open but require snow chains for all non-4x4 vehicles. Luckily, the Tacoma was a 4×4 off-road model—this is when I truly appreciated the rental, especially since rental companies prohibit putting chains on their cars.

As I made my way up, the landscape shifted dramatically. Partway through the ascent, I spotted a meandering river, completely frozen. By the time I reached the top, everything was blanketed in snow.

This was my first time driving in snow—and in a rental, no less (sorry, Alamo). Thankfully, nothing went wrong.

The trip was unforgettable. The only thing I would’ve changed is having someone to split the cost of the rental. Maybe next time.
