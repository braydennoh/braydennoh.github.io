Hi, I’m **Brayden**, a senior at **Caltech** studying **Earth science** and **computational modeling**. My work focuses on combining field observations, remote sensing, and physics-based models to better understand landscape evolution and natural hazards.

I’ve been fortunate to collaborate with **Michael Lamb** ([lamb.caltech.edu](https://lamb.caltech.edu/)), **Omar Wani** ([omarwani.com](https://www.omarwani.com/)), and **Karl Lang** ([karllang.info](https://www.karllang.info/)) on projects ranging from probabilistic risk modeling for river migration to tectonic geomorphology. Starting this fall, I’ll be pursuing a PhD in Earth and Planetary Sciences at **Harvard**, advised by **Brendan Meade** ([brendanjmeade.github.io](https://brendanjmeade.github.io/)).

You’ll find a few of my selected projects and publications below, along with updates and contact information. Thanks for visiting.
