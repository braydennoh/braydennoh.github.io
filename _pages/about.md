Hi, I’m **Brayden**, a senior at **Caltech** studying **Earth science** and **computational modeling**. My work focuses on coupling surface and subsurface processes to quantitatively understand landscape evolution and natural hazards.

I’ve been fortunate to work with [**Michael Lamb**](https://lamb.caltech.edu/), [**Omar Wani**](https://www.omarwani.com/), [**Karl Lang**](https://www.karllang.info/), and [**Vinamra Agrawal**](https://vinagr.github.io/) on projects ranging from asteroid impact simulations to geomorphic probabilistic risk modeling. Starting this fall, I’ll be pursuing a PhD in Earth and Planetary Sciences at **Harvard**, advised by [**Brendan Meade**](https://brendanjmeade.github.io/).

You’ll find a few of my selected projects and publications below, along with updates and contact information. Thanks for visiting.
