Hi, I’m **Brayden**, a senior at **Caltech** studying Earth science and computational modeling. My work focuses on coupling surface and subsurface processes to quantitatively understand landscape evolution and natural hazards.

I’ve previously worked with [Michael Lamb](https://lamb.caltech.edu/), [Omar Wani](https://www.omarwani.com/), [Karl Lang](https://www.karllang.info/), and [Vinamra Agrawal](https://vinagr.github.io/) on projects ranging from asteroid impact simulations to geomorphic probabilistic risk modeling.

Starting this fall, I’ll be pursuing a PhD in Earth and Planetary Sciences at **Harvard**, where I’ll be advised by [Brendan Meade](https://brendanjmeade.github.io/).
