  abstract = {Lateral migration of meandering rivers poses erosional risks to human settlements, roads, and infrastructure in alluvial floodplains. While there is a large body of scientific literature on the dominant mechanisms driving river migration, it is still not possible to accurately predict river meander evolution over multiple years. This is in part because we don't fully understand the relative contribution of each mechanism and because deterministic mathematical models are not equipped to account for stochasticity in the system. Besides, uncertainty due to model-structure deficits and unknown parameter values remains. For a more reliable assessment of risks, we, therefore, need probabilistic forecasts. Here, we present a workflow to generate geomorphic risk maps for river migration using probabilistic modeling. We start with a simple geometric model for river migration, where nominal migration rates increase with local and upstream curvature. We then account for model structure deficits using smooth random functions. Probabilistic forecasts for river channel position over time are generated by monte carlo runs using a distribution of model parameter values inferred from satellite data. We provide a recipe for parameter inference within the Bayesian framework. We demonstrate that such risk maps are relatively more informative in avoiding false negatives, which can be both detrimental and costly, in the context of assessing erosional hazards due to river migration. Our results show that with longer prediction time horizons, the spatial uncertainty of erosional hazard within the entire channel belt increases – with more geographical area falling within 25 % < probability < 75 %. However, forecasts also become more confident about erosion for regions immediately in the vicinity of the river, especially on its cut-bank side. Probabilistic modeling thus allows us to quantify our degree of confidence – which is spatially and temporally variable – in river migration forecasts. We also note that to increase the reliability of these risk maps, we need to describe the first-order dynamics in our model to a reasonable degree of accuracy, and simple geometric models do not always possess such accuracy.},

  abstract = {Asteroid parameters such as size, density, and velocity govern how the asteroid is deformed in the atmosphere, forecasting if the asteroid will explode in the air (airburst) or impact the ground. A broad outline for asteroids entering the atmosphere is simple. Large asteroids survive, while small asteroids disintegrate by air friction. However, the simple concept of kinetic energy lost by air can be extended by adding a relevant aspect of asteroids: porosity. In small solar system objects, asteroids are expected to have porosities of 10-60%, and pore spaces change how the asteroid is compact with pressure, leading to more complex asteroid interaction with the atmosphere. Asteroids fall at thousands of meters per second, conventionally making it difficult to observe. Therefore, computational simulations will allow us to visualize how porosity influences the asteroid during its atmospheric entry. Visualizing the simulation data is critical to properly understanding the asteroid atmospheric entry and impact crater process. The fundamental belief of the project is not only to make comprehensive visualizations but ones that the audience can understand without any background knowledge. Using iSALE2D, internal physical model of the asteroid are presented. The visualization shows that asteroid porosity level has fundamental effects on atmospheric entry and impact cratering process. Therefore, when looking into hazardous asteroids, not only we should consider size, density, and velocity, but also porosity.},
