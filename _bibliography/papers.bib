  abstract = {Asteroid parameters such as size, density, and velocity govern how the asteroid is deformed in the atmosphere, forecasting if the asteroid will explode in the air (airburst) or impact the ground. A broad outline for asteroids entering the atmosphere is simple. Large asteroids survive, while small asteroids disintegrate by air friction. However, the simple concept of kinetic energy lost by air can be extended by adding a relevant aspect of asteroids: porosity. In small solar system objects, asteroids are expected to have porosities of 10-60%, and pore spaces change how the asteroid is compact with pressure, leading to more complex asteroid interaction with the atmosphere. Asteroids fall at thousands of meters per second, conventionally making it difficult to observe. Therefore, computational simulations will allow us to visualize how porosity influences the asteroid during its atmospheric entry.Visualizing the simulation data is critical to properly understanding the asteroid atmospheric entry and impact crater process. The fundamental belief of the project is not only to make comprehensive visualizations but ones that the audience can understand without any background knowledge. Using iSALE2D, internal physical model of the asteroid are presented. The visualization shows that asteroid porosity level has fundamental effects on atmospheric entry and impact cratering process. Therefore, when looking into hazardous asteroids, not only we should consider size, density, and velocity, but also porosity.},
